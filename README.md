# Content Warning Plugin

This is a simple WordPress plugin developed by Volkan Sah and OpenAI's ChatGPT (I was realy to lazy this morning!). After 2 Mistakes with GPT, we get it. Its funny for simple functions!

It adds a content warning to posts that are in specific categories. The warning informs readers with your Text and it asks them to confirm if they want to continue reading.

## How to use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Upload the `content-warning-plugin.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. To add the warning, simply add your post to the 'example-category' category.

## Customize

You can change the 'example-category' in the code to the category you want to show the warning for. You can also modify the warning message to suit your needs.
